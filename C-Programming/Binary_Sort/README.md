## Binary Sorting

- Binary insertion sort is a sorting algorithm which is similar to the insertion sort, but instead of using linear search to find the location where an element should be inserted, we use binary search. Thus, we reduce the comparative value of inserting a single element from O (N) to O (log N).

- It is a flexible algorithm, which means it works faster when the same given members are already heavily sorted, i.e., the current location of the feature is closer to its actual location in the sorted list.

- It is a stable filtering algorithm – elements with the same values ​​appear in the same sequence in the last order as they were in the first list.
